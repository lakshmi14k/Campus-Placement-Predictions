**CAMPUS PLACEMENT PREDICTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains details of the final project completed as part of the course INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor Nik Bear Brown

**OVERVIEW**

In today's competitive job market, predicting campus placements accurately is crucial for both students and educational institutions. Leveraging the power of data science and machine learning, our Streamlit application aims to provide insights into the likelihood of a student being placed based on various criteria. Our application utilizes a dataset comprising 15 columns, including academic performance metrics, personal information, and other relevant factors. Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that influence placement outcomes.
